Haha When you need a website, what would you do? First of all, you need to prepare your content. You may use Microsoft Word or a Markdown editor. And then you need to convert it into HTML pages and put into a web server. Alternatively, you can spend hours to find a content management system from hundreds of options, such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Confluence, you name it. A few months later, you find the system you choose is so hard to use that you have to find a replacement. So you spend hours and hours again exploring new options until you are frustrated and want to give up. Is there on earth a tool to generate high-quality websites from plain text files in real-time and show it to the world? Yes, we have. Document Node is born for the mission to simplify the toolchain from writing to online publishing. Using Document Node, the only thing you need to manage is a folder containing plain text files. Document Node will generate different kind of websites from the plain text folder and syncs changes in real-time. What Document Node offers? Document Node provides a truly native and lightweight desktop application written in C++, for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The DMG file size for Mac edition is as small as 12.9 MB. Distraction-free writing experience Document Node offers a professional grade of writing experience. In the editor-only typewriter mode, you can fully concentrate on your writing, no one can interrupt your current thinking. Real-time preview and website generating You can preview your writing in real-time side by side. By pressing the “Run” button, your Markdown project will instantly be run as a beautiful, fully functional documentation site, with live-reload. From zero configuration to 100% control, Document Node will present documentation websites to you in the simplest way. Fast refactoring, control the big picture No special folder structure needs to follow in Document Node. You are free to arrange your Markdown files in the most appropriate way as you like. You can refactor almost anything in Document Node, namely moving files and folders around and reordering them, via a simple drag-and-drop. It's also easy to move sections around within one document by drag-and-drop on its headings outline. Most importantly, all changes will be updated on your local documentation website in milliseconds automatically, thanks to the live-reload feature. One click away to publish your masterpiece When you want to make your documentation public, just click the “Publish” button and your masterpiece will be available at https://[your_site].documentnode.io in seconds. In future versions, your public documentation can also be automatically updated if you tell Document Node the location of your Markdown files, for example, in GitHub, Dropbox or Google Drive. Where We Are Now After months of hard work, as you can see from the video and screenshots, we have a real working application already, with roughly 70% of the functionality of the first version done. We are launching a KickStarter campaign. With your support, we can continue our hard-work and release the first stable version of Document Node quicker. Your backing will help fund: Development time. We want to ship the first stable version of Document Node to public by the end of April 2019. Quality assurance. We have very high quality standard and want to invest more resources on testing. User community. The future of Document Node will be driven by users' voice, so we want to build a helpful user community from day one. Whenever you have any questions or ideas, you can always quickly find someone to talk. We want to complete this by the end of July 2019.
